*NOTE: This is a work in progress. Pardon the mess.*

GDB is the GNU debugger available with Propeller GCC for debugging
programs.

> Requirements
> ------------
>
> To use Propeller GDB, the Propeller GCC version must be at least
> Alpha\_1\_9. This is built from the propgcc.googlecode.com default
> branch. Currently, the command is the only debugger available. Some
> GUI tools may be integrated at some point.

> Starting GDB
> ------------
>
> Since GDB is only available on the command line at the moment, open a
> window that has propeller-gcc (C:or /opt/parallax/bin) in it's PATH.
> On windows, this can be done by clicking the C:.bat file in explorer.

> We will use a hello project just to get started. Go to some
> development folder and do the following steps. 1. Create a hello.c
> file as shown below. 1. Compile using this command:
> **propeller-elf-gcc -g -o hello.elf -c hello.c** 1. Load (assuming
> 5MHz crystal) like this: **propeller-load -g -r hello.elf** 1. Start
> gdb like this: **propeller-elf-gdb hello.elf** 1. Enter "c" (without
> quotes) to run the program 1. Press CTRL-C a few times, then type quit

> The output should look like below. Most of the output of GDB is
> actually meaningless, but that's GDB output that is controlled by FSF
> and not the Propeller-GCC developers. While it may seem a little
> overwhelming now, the output will make much more sense after reading
> the sections in this wiki page.

> The hello.c source.

    #include <stdio.h>
    void main(void)
    {
      puts("Hello, world.");
    }

> Code Stepping
> -------------
>
> Stepping through code allows us to enter (and test assumptions) about
> a thread of execution in a program. Mechanically inclined people learn
> more about coding from this than by reading half-dozen programming
> books.

> Setting Breakpoints
> -------------------
>
> Setting a breakpoint is a very common thing to do in a debugger.

> Displaying Data
> ---------------
>
> While stepping through code it may be necessary to examine and/or
> change the value of some variables.
