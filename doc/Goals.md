### Project Goals

-   GCC will compile/link C and/or C++ programs
-   GCC will produce PASM-GAS COG code
-   Device drivers may also be written in PASM and combined with C/C++
    programs
-   GCC will produce LMM (Large Memory Model) code programs
-   GCC will allow running programs on external memory platforms
    XMM/XMMC
-   GCC will allow debugging via GDB over the console serial port
-   GCC will generate optimized code based on size/speed
-   A flexible loader application will be used to program Propeller
-   GCC will allow users to specify loader parameters in a simple way
-   GCC will allow users to define their own drivers in a simple way
-   GCC will allow users to specify linker controlled memory areas
-   GCC will run on popular operating systems - Mac, Linux, and Windows
-   GCC should work with Eclipse, Net Beans, Code::Blocks, and other GUI
    programs
-   There will be limited versions of some C libraries because of
    Propeller constraints
-   GCC will be free and open source according to GNU licensing terms
-   MIT licensed demonstration programs will be provided
-   Volunteer tester application efforts will be supported and
    highlighted for achievement

### Project Status

-   GCC can compile/link C and/or C++ programs
-   GAS can produce PASM-GAS COG code
-   GCC allows in-line GAS code
-   Device drivers can be written in GAS/PASM and combined with C/C++
    programs
-   GCC can generate COG C programs
-   GCC can generate LMM C programs
-   GCC can generate CMM C programs (Compact Memory Model)
-   GCC can generate XMMC C programs with code external memory
-   GCC can generate XMM C programs with code and data in external
    memory
-   GCC can generate All Model C programs that can start COGC COGS
-   GCC can generate All Model C programs that can start GAS COGS
-   GCC can generate All Model C programs that can start PASM COGS
-   GCC can generate optimized code based on size/speed
-   GCC lets users define their own device drivers in a simple way
-   Programs can be loaded and run on Propeller hardware with
    propeller-load
-   Predefined linker scripts are available; custom scripts can be used
-   Limited versions of some C libraries are provided
-   GCC meets all license requirements
-   GCC works with Eclipse, Netbeans, Codeblocks, and Geany IDEs
-   GCC works with SimpleIDE - available as an installer for Linux, MAC,
    and Windows

-   GDB debugging has been deferred by Parallax to the Propeller II
    project
