propgcc-v0\_2\_4 - snap time: 2012-03-07-14:00:23

Various propeller load changes:

Directory /opt/parallax/propeller-load is reorganized so that board
types are in separate .cfg config files. Added rcfast.cfg and
rcslow.cfg.

The propeller-load program now exits more quickly if a propeller is not
found on a port.

There were cases where propeller-load waited too long after reset before
starting the load process. An extra 50 milli-second delay was removed
and the loader is solid now. The old loader was prone to having trouble
with QuickStart boards.

Fixed a bug in the SimpleSerial driver that could cause trouble at lower
baud-rates.

The ebasic demo program now has CAT, LOAD, and SAVE commands (enabled
with -DLOAD\_SAVE flags). Some propeller specific commands have also
been added such as HIGH, LOW, TOGGLE, DIR, GETDIR, CNT, PAUSE, PULSEIN,
and PULSEOUT - see ebasic README.txt.

Most other changes are related to gdb.

propgcc-v0\_2\_2 - snap time: 2011-12-21

Fixed the C3 XMM driver so that it works correctly if started when an SD
card is inserted.

Changed the way the linker allocates cog overlays. Previously there were
fixed cog overlay sections named ".cogsys0" - ".cogsys7" and ".coguser0"
-".coguser7". Now any section starting or ending with ".cog" is treated
as an overlay for cog memory.

Released library source code as a separate archive (propgcc-libsrc) and
moved demos into their own file (propgcc-demos).

Some minor bug fixes:

    Updated demos for new linker naming scheme.
    Improved output of code in -mspin mode (and include a small spin wrapper for the pasm code).
    Fixed an issue where _COGMEM variables were sometimes placed in the wrong sections.
    Added a C++ wrapper for assert.h.
    Added the isnan function to libm.

propgcc-v0\_2\_1 - snap time: 2011-12-10

Fixed several packaging problems with the release.

Other changes:

    Fixed the missing gmtime function and incorrect prototype for it.
    Fixed the copy_from_xmm function in propeller.h which was causing some demos to fail to build in XMM mode.
    Added a single-cog pong demo.

NOTE: there is an unresolved problem with downloading XMM and XMMC code
to the C3 board when an SD card is inserted. Please remove any SD card
before launching XMM and XMMC programs on your C3 board. We are looking
into this.

propgcc-v0\_2\_0 - snap time: 2011-12-09

We've bumped the version number for this release, because there's been a
major change in the way the compiler accesses data in external memory.
The new way is smaller (2 longs per access instead of 3) and faster, but
is not compatible -- you'll have to make sure you delete any old XMM
object files before using the new compiler.

Other changes:

    New batch files PropGCC.bat and addpath.bat to simplify command line development on Windows (see README_WINDOWS.txt).
    Made memcpy work when copying data from code space to hub RAM in XMMC mode.
    Fixed the __builtin_propeller_waitvid function to generate the correct code.
    Fixed initialization of variables declared in cog memory.
    The disassembler shows the "brs" pseudo-instruction in LMM code.
    Added a simple basic interpreter demo (ebasic) from David Betz.
    Added a pthreads_toggle demo.
    Various other bug fixes and demo improvements.
    Added C3F board type for faster C3 XMMC programs. Thanks Dave Hein.
    Added a -v switch to propeller-load to show progress in port scanning.

NOTE: there is an unresolved problem with downloading XMM and XMMC code
to the C3 board when an SD card is inserted. Please remove any SD card
before launching XMM and XMMC programs on your C3 board. We are looking
into this.

propgcc-v0\_1\_9 - snap time: 2011-11-25-16:55:5

    Smaller 32bit double library support (64bit still default).
    Build and load small main programs for COG mode, other improvements, and bug fixes.
    Licensing files and information - more complete. Waiting for legal review.
    Windows support without Cygwin.
    Various Alpha tester demos (Ariba, blittled, Heater, Kevin Wood, Mindrobots, Rienhart, others).
    Console input/output LF/CR fixes for PST
    More library support for ANSI C99
    Add ASC to propeller-load.cfg

    Added PropGCC.bat to start a Propeller-GCC windows command console.

    Many other enhancements.

propgcc-v0\_1\_8 - was preliminary only.

propgcc-v0\_1\_7 - snap time: 2011-11-03-18:02:28

Notes:

Build with latest fixes. Windows v0\_1\_7 has more features than Linux
v0\_1\_7 because of version tracker issue.

1.  Includes grep and .dll missing from previous build.
2.  Includes updates to loader and board types.
3.  Includes propeller.h which has common propeller functions.
4.  Includes c3files filetest for SD card.

propgcc-v0\_1\_3 - snap time: 2011-10-27-10:38:11

Notes:

Users can build XMMC programs (code only in external memory) and run
them in EEPROM. One example is xbasic for 128KB Hydra EEPROM (or C3).

    $ cd demos/xbasic
    $ make

    #for 128K byte EEPROM
    $ propeller-load -r -t xbasic.elf -b eeprom -p <port name>
    #or for C3
    $ propeller-load -r -t xbasic.elf -b c3 -p <port name>

    In xbasic enter this program:
    10 printf("Count to 100\n")
    20 for n = 0 to 100
    30  if n mod 10 = 0 then
    40    printf("\n")
    50  end if
    60  printf("%d ",n)
    70 next n

    In xbasic enter: run

    Output:

    run
    H:496 O:4 D:114 V:1 T:124
    Count to 100
