title: Build Prerequisites
---

The current trunk GCC build prerequisites are listed here:
http://gcc.gnu.org/install/prerequisites.html

What follows on this page are the build requisites that are necessary to
build PropellerGCC.

Linux Build Requirements
------------------------

-   The best Linux for building Propeller GCC today is Debian Linux.
    Ubuntu (tested with 12.04, 12.10, and 13.04) works fine as well.
-   Use VirtualBox on Windows and install Debian if you like.
-   ARM based distributions can be built on the host (RaspberryPi,
    etc.).
-   Windows can be cross-compiled on Linux with the mingw32 package.
    make CROSS=win32

Necessary Packages
------------------

Once you have a good Linux distribution, some things must be added. If
you look at the main GCC Prerequisites page, you will note an
overwhelming number of items. As a minimum for PropGCC, you should
install:

-   Mercurial source control
-   GNU make version 3.80 (or later)
-   autoconf version 2.64
-   automake version 1.11.1
-   Bison
-   Flex version 2.5.4 (or later)
-   gettext version 0.14.5 (or later)
-   GNU m4 version 1.4.6 (or later)
-   Perl version 5.6.1 (or later)
-   Texinfo version 4.7 (or later) (version 4.13 for Ubuntu 13.10 ...
    see below)
-   Ncurses development files for termcap (try "libncurses-dev" or
    "libncurses5-dev")
-   expat-dev (try "libexpat1-dev")

Items in our repository. Please don't add these separately:

-   GNU binutils
-   MPC Library version 0.8.1
-   MPFR Library version 2.4.2
-   GNU Multiple Precision Library (GMP) version 4.3.2 (or later) - see
    Prerequisites!

Other items:

-   DejaGnu 1.4.4 - test suite stuff only
-   Expect - test suite stuff only
-   Tcl - test suite stuff only
-   TexLive - for creating pdf documentation

Building on Ubuntu 13.10 requires texinfo4.13 using these instructions:

    wget http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/texinfo/texinfo-4.13a.tar.gz
    tar -zxvf texinfo-4.13a.tar.gz
    cd texinfo-4.13
    ./configure
    make
    sudo make install

    makeinfo --help

See the trunk GCC Prerequisites link for more details. Many of the other
libraries in the Prerequisites page seem to be installed by default in
most distributions.

Installing with VirtualBox
--------------------------

1.  Download debian-6.0.2.1-i386-netinst \> (Later version of debian may
    be necessary for mingw cross-compiler builds - see comments below.)
2.  Make a CD with the distribution
3.  Install VirtualBox on the PC
4.  Install debian from CD booted in VirtualBox
5.  Use root access or sudo for the following
6.  \$ apt-get install mercurial
7.  \$ apt-get install flex
8.  \$ apt-get install bison
9.  \$ apt-get install autoconf
10. \$ apt-get install gettext
11. \$ apt-get install texlive
12. \$ apt-get install texinfo (if missing)
13. \$ apt-get install ncurses-dev

Other packages seemed to be there already except for GMP, etc... GMP is
committed to the propgcc repository.

If you want to use VirtualBox Linux to download programs to a Propeller
chip, you will need to enable the device in the VirtualBox Devices menu.
Also, when accessing the serial port, you will need to use \$ sudo
adduser \$USER dialout .... Then reboot.
