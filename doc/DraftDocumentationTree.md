### PropGCC DRAFT Documentation

5/7/12 - An attempt to pull together all the various bits and pieces of
PropGCC documentation scattered all over the place. As with most things,
built upon the work of those that have gone before me.

11/10/13 - Some updates and clarifications to the "draft". Most likely
this will be removed unless someone indicates a desire to build on it
soon.

It's ugly right now. This is just an outlining tool at this point to
gather thoughts and structure. Feel free to comment.

PropellerGCC Documentation
==========================

PropellerGCC Quick Start
------------------------

### SimpleIDE

SimpleIDE is:

-   A multiple O/S and internationalized Integrated Development
    Environment designed specifically for Propeller GCC
-   For writing programs, managing project compile/link, and programming
    Propeller in one application
-   For integrating Propeller PASM, COG C source, and/or Propeller SMP
    threading into projects
-   For programmers that do not want to use the more flexible but
    steeper learning curve "make" system
-   For programmers who will not miss features like integrated source
    control or debugging
-   For users who do not want to install Java or .Net on their Linux,
    MAC, or Windows computer

SimpleIDE is not designed to meet expectations of large enterprise class
professional programmer or management. A professional C/C++ programmer
can use PropellerGCC with Eclipse, Netbeans, or other IDEs.

### Propeller GCC Command Line Package

This project is a GCC port for the [Parallax Propeller P8x32a
Microcontroller](http://www.parallax.com/PropellerChips/tabid/833/Default.aspx).
