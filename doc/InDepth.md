title: In-Depth Explanation

The Parallax Propeller has a unique architecture which was designed for
the Spin and PASM (Propeller Assembler) languages, not for C or C++.
Some of the incompatibilities are: \* Programs run in one of eight cogs,
each with their own memory. Cogs can communicate through hub memory, but
they don't have access to the memory in any of the other cogs. \* Hub
memory and cog memory maps both start at location 0, but they don't
overlap; they are very distinct memory areas that need to be accessed
with different machine language instructions. \* Each cog memory
location is a 32-bit longword, but each hub memory location is an 8-bit
byte. \* There are no registers like you might find in other processors:
all instructions work with a source and a destination memory location.
\* There is no built-in stack; instead of storing return addresses on a
stack, the instruction at the end of a subroutine is modified to jump
back to the correct location.

The engineers who ported GCC to the Propeller did an awesome job solving
-- or at least working around -- these problems, while still making it
possible to use all the same features that Spin and PASM programmers
enjoy.

This page provides background information about some of the aspects of
how PropGCC compiles your C code to machine language. The information
also applies to C++ but the sample code fragments use C. It will also
tell you how to combine different memory models to use the advantages of
each.

The document was written for programmers who already have experience
with C, but are new to the Propeller. Knowledge of Spin or PASM is not
required, but you should at least have some idea of the architecture of
the Propeller. Before you continue reading the rest of this page, you

Memory Models and Mixed-Mode Programming
========================================

The Propeller microcontroller can run up to (about) 20 million
instructions per second per cog, when it's running at 80MHz. When you
compile programss in the "cog" memory model, PropGCC generates code that
runs at this full speed. This is also called *"native mode"*.

But each cog of the Propeller only has limited memory space for
instructions and data: 496 longs of 32 bits each. The PropGCC developers
recognized that this is not enough for many programs, so you can choose
from a number of different [memory models](PropGccMemory.md) depending
on your needs.

For example, when using LMM (Large Memory Model), a small kernel is
started which retrieves one machine language instruction from the hub at
a time, and then executes it. Obviously this makes the code run slower,
but it changes the maximum code size for your program to almost 32KB
instead of 2KB. Other memory models allow you to store parts of your
program in an EEPROM, or on an SD card, permitting even larger programs.

In many projects, you will find that the speed penalty of a non-native
memory model is acceptable for most of the program, but not for some
parts. You'll want to compile the time-critical parts, such as the
modules that communicate directly with the hardware, in cog mode, and
the rest of the program in another memory model. This is called
*"mixed-mode programming"*.

You can have as many `.cogc` modules in your project as you want. Some
early code or documentation may have mentioned that there is only enough
space for eight `.cogc` modules but this is no longer true. It made no
sense either: there is no reason to limit the number of cog segments
(and thus the number of `.cogc` modules) to 8. It's true that only 8
cogs can execute code at a time, but it's very well possible to re-use a
hardware cog for many different purposes. For example, your program
could have a `.cogc` module that generates a video signal and another
`.cogc` module that generates a bitmap file, and decide at run-time
which module you want to run on a particular cog.

> In SimpleIDE, all `.cogc` files of your project must be in the same
> directory as your `.side` file.

The reason that all `.cogc` modules need to be in the project directory
is that the build process uses the file location (relative to the
`.side` file) to rename some symbols in the object file. If you would
put a `.cogc` file in another directory, the build process would attempt
to use the slash ('/') or backslash ('') from the path name as part of
the name of those renamed symbols, and the build fails because those
characters are illegal as part of those symbols.

Under the Hood
==============

Before we get into further details about how to program a `.cogc`
module, it may help to take a look at some aspects of how PropGCC
translates your C code to Assembler, and how a cog runs your code.

Startup Code
------------

Whenever the Propeller starts a cog, it copies a block of memory from
the hub to cog memory, and then starts executing at location 0 in cog
memory. The code that gets placed there is the C runtime library startup
code,
[crt0\_cog.s](http://code.google.com/p/propgcc/source/browse/lib/cog/crt0_cog.s).
This is what happens in the initialization code: 1. The stack pointer
(discussed [below](PropGccInDepth#Stack_Pointer:_sp.md)) is copied from
`PAR`. 1. The `r0` pseudo-register is copied from `PAR`. That way, if
`main()` is declared with a parameter, this is used as its value. 1. If
this is the first cog that gets started, it allocates a lock for the
runtime library. The lock is shared between all cogs that run C code. 1.
If this is the first cog that gets started, it wipes the hub memory area
where all static and global variables reside (commonly known as BSS). 1.
The code calls `_main` which is the public symbol of the `main()`
function. 1. After `main()` returns, the code calls `__exit` which stops
the cog (see [this source
file](http://code.google.com/p/propgcc/source/browse/lib/cog/crtend_cog.s)).

Here's an important thing to notice from the above:

> Static variables in hub memory are only initialized to zero when the
> first cog is started, right after a reset. Cog memory static
> variables, however, are initialized every time the code is loaded into
> a cog and started with `cognew()`.

As you may notice from the `crt0_cog.s` source code, that the
pseudo-registers (which are explained
[below](PropGccInDepth#General-Purpose_Pseudo-Registers:_r0_-_r15.md))
are in the same locations as the initialization code.

> You ***cannot*** restart the code in your cog by doing something like
> `__asm__("jmp #0")`. The initialization code gets overwritten with
> pseudo-register values immediately, so it won't exist anymore by the
> time your code is executed.

General-Purpose Pseudo-Registers: `r0`-`r15`
--------------------------------------------

The Propeller doesn't have any registers in the usual sense. All machine
language instructions have a source and a destination, which are usually
locations in cog memory, or 9-bit immediate values, and sometimes hub
addresses, depending on the instruction.

The GCC compiler depends on having registers available to hold temporary
values, and also to pass parameters to functions. The Propeller port of
the GCC compiler generates Assembly code that uses up to 15
pseudo-registers (`r0`-`r14`) for temporary values, all 32 bits. When
the assembler translates instructions that use these pseudo-registers,
it actually uses the first 15 longwords in cog memory.

Stack Pointer: `sp`
-------------------

The Propeller doesn't have a built-in stack. The easiest way to call a
subroutine in Assembly language is to use the `JMPRET` instruction which
stores the location of the next instruction before it jumps to the
subroutine. Normally the destination of the `JMPRET` is the location of
a `JMP` instruction at the end of the subroutine: the JMPRET stores the
return address in the return instruction that way. This is very
efficient of course, but doesn't allow for recursivity: if a function is
called before it returns (either by itself or by another function), the
return address gets overwritten.

In order to implement a stack to make recursion and other features
possible, the PropGCC compiler uses the `sp` pseudo-register as a stack
pointer. Just like the other pseudo-registers, `sp` is stored near the
start of cog memory. The stack itself is stored in hub memory and grows
top-down, i.e. to push a value, the code decrements `sp` first, and then
stores the value.

> want to run the same `.cogc` module on multiple cogs simultaneously,
> you need to provide a different `PAR` value (i.e. second `cognew()`
> parameter) for each cog that's running. More about this
> [below](PropGccInDepth#Second_Parameter_to_cognew().md).

Link Register: `lr`
-------------------

As mentioned above, the stack is stored in the hub. That means pushing
data onto the stack and popping data from it are hub operations which
are relatively expensive. Also, the `JMPRET` instruction which is the
instruction of choice for function calls, uses a cog memory location
(not a hub location) to store the return address. For these reasons, the
compiler uses another pseudo-register `lr` which is also stored at the
top of cog memory. The extra register makes it unnecessary to push and
pop the return address to and from the stack if a function doesn't call
any other functions.

To illustrate this, here's some sample code. Say, a function `caller`
calls a function `calledfunction`. The code that gets generated is as
follows:

    _caller
        sub     sp, #4
        wrlong  lr, sp     ; save "caller"'s return address on stack

        ...

        jmpret  lr, #_calledfunction ; call other function

        ...

        rdlong  lr, sp     ; restore return address
        add     sp, #4

        jmp     lr         ; return from "caller"

    _calledfunction
        ... No need to save lr on stack if function doesn't call
        ... any other functions

        jmp     lr         ; return from "calledfunction"

As you may have seen in the [C runtime startup
code](http://code.google.com/p/propgcc/source/browse/lib/cog/crt0_cog.s),
the `lr` register is initialized so that when `main()` returns with the
usual `JMP lr`, the code jumps to the `_exit()` function (in assembler:
`__exit` because by convention, the compiler adds an underscore to all
symbol names) which stops the cog. In other words: all you need to do to
stop the cog is return from the `main()` function.

When a function is declared `_NATIVE` or `_NAKED`, it uses a different
calling convention that doesn't use the `lr` register. More information
about this will follow [below](PropGccInDepth#_NATIVE_and__NAKED.md).

The `main()` Function
=====================

Each Propeller cog is a processor that executes its own program,
independently from the other cogs. And each `.cogc` module should be
regarded as a *"program within a program"*, rather than as a module that
contains functions you can call.

> Because a `.cogc` module is a "program within a program", each `.cogc`
> module must have a `main()` function.

Just like the `main()` function at the top level of your main program,
the `main()` function of your `.cogc` is the first function that gets
executed and it's the last function that returns, unless you have an
infinite loop or stop the cog yourself, of course.

It may seem a bit weird to name the top-level function `main`, because
`.cogc` modules usually only take care of a small part of the
functionality of an application (i.e. they're usually not the "main"
function of the program), but the C runtime library depends on this, as
you may have seen in the [previous
chapter](PropGccInDepth#Startup_Code.md).

> If you forget to put a `main()` in your `.cogc` file, or if you try to
> rename `main()` to something else, you will get a somewhat weird
> "relocation truncated" error from the PropGCC compiler.

As part of the processing for `.cogc` modules, SimpleIDE uses the
`propeller-elf-objcopy` program to rename the `.text` segment i.e. the
part of the object file where all the code is stored. This results in a
few things: \* `.cogc` modules are artificially prevented from calling
functions in (or use pointers to functions from) other modules: if you
try it anyway, you will get a fatal "relocation truncated" linker error.
\* Similarly, it's artificially made impossible to call functions in, or
take function pointers from any other module: a `.cogc` module can call
library functions but not any functions in other modules in your
project. \* Even though the `main()` function must be public (so it can
be called from `crt0_cog.s`; see [the previous
chapter](PropGccInDepth#Startup_Code.md)), there will not be any
conflicts with other public symbols `main`, e.g. the `main()` function
that's the top level function of your program, or the `main()` functions
of any other `.cogc` modules.

Note: renaming the `.text` segment doesn't affect *data* access: Your
`.cogc` module can access any global public data in the hub. You can
declare that data either in the `.cogc` file itself, or in an `#include`
file.

Defining `main()` in the `.cogc` Module
---------------------------------------

This is probably the most common form of `main()` in `.cogc` modules:

    void main(void *mailbox)
    {
        ...
    }

The `mailbox` parameter is passed via the `PAR` special register, but so
is the initial value for the stack pointer `sp`. The parameter is
usually a pointer to a `struct` in hub memory, so instead of using the
`void *` type, you can also use the type of the struct you use (e.g.
`void main(struct mailbox_t *struct)`.

> Passing a non-pointer (e.g. an integer that designates a pin number)
> is not possible unless you verify that your `.cogc` module doesn't use

If you don't need a mailbox, you can declare your `main()` to ignore the
optional parameter:

    void main(void)
    {
        ...
    }

For the return type of `main()`, you should simply use `void`. Changing
the return type to something else is not going to cause any problems,
but there's no way to retrieve the return value. If the `main()`
function needs to convey some sort of result, you will have to do it
through the mailbox or through a global variable.

`_NATIVE` and `_NAKED`
======================

Because of the absence of an intrinsic stack, PropGCC uses a calling
convention that's unique to the Propeller. By default, functions
compiled in the COG memory model use the `lr` pseudo-register to store
the return address. If a function needs to call another function, it has
to push the `lr` register onto the stack before it can use it for the
next calling level. This is a compromise that makes it possible to call
functions recursively.

But the use of the stack in hub memory results in some very specific
problems: First of all, it's difficult to predict how big the stack
needs to be. Secondly, the instructions to push and pop the instructions
onto and from the stack will slow down the execution.

> instructions (which are translated to `JMPRET` and `JMP`) by declaring

If you call a `_NATIVE` function recursively, the function will never
return because the return instruction will always jump back to the
instruction after the recursive `JMPRET` instruction.

When using the `_NATIVE` attribute, the compiler generates a label at
the end of the function where the `RET` instruction is stored. But the
optimizer will eliminate the `RET` instruction and the label if it
detects that the function has an infinite loop (e.g. a `for(;;)` with no
`break`), and you will get a linker error because the function call
needs a reference to the return label for `_NATIVE` functions.

> You can force the compiler to use the native `JMP` instruction to call
> a function that never returns, by using the `_NAKED` modifier.

Any function declared with `_NAKED` should *never* return: it should
either go into an infinite loop or it should stop the cog. If you use
`_NAKED` on a function that is intended to return, the results are
unpredictable because the compiler will not generate any code at the end
of the function, so the cog will drop into the next function in memory.
Neither the compiler nor the linker will catch this mistake.

Compiling a function with `_NATIVE` or `_NAKED` also changes the
compiler's behavior for data storage: Local variables (other than the
ones that are represented by registers) are stored in cog memory by
default, instead of on the stack. More about this in the next section.

Where the Compiler Stores Data
==============================

Static Data
-----------

Whenever you declare static data, it will get stored in the hub by
default. This goes for static data inside functions, as well as global
data. This is true regardless of which memory model you use.

You can use the `_COGMEM` attribute with declarations of variables to
let the compiler store them in cog memory instead of hub memory. This is
more efficient because no hub operation is required to access the
variable. Note that if the variable is part of a `.cogc` module,
declaring it with `_COGMEM` makes it inaccessible to other modules.
Similarly, if a `_COGMEM` variable is declared in a non-`.cogc` module,
it will be accessible to all other modules but not to any `.cogc`
modules because it will end up in the kernel cog of the memory model you
use. When this happens, the compilation will succeed but you will get a
linker error.

> Global variables in the hub are initialized once, when the Propeller
> starts the first cog. But variables in the cog are initialized every
> time a `.cogc` module is started.

In other words, if you stop a cog that's running a particular `.cogc`
module, restarting the cog with with same `.cogc` module will reset all
variables. This is in line with the "program in a program" paradigm:
every time you start the subprogram cog, the variables are initialized
to the same values.

Whenever you store data in the hub that's used by multiple cogs, don't
forget to declare the data with the `volatile` keyword so the compiler
knows the data cannot be cached in a register. For example:

      // declarations of global data e.g. in an #include file
      unsigned hubvar1;
      volatile unsigned hubvar2;

      ...

      // In a .cogc file:

      // The following code will get optimized away because the compiler
      // assumes that hubvar1 won't be changed by other threads/cogs
      hubvar1 = 0;
      if (!hubvar1) // compiler thinks this is always false
      {
        ... // Code here doesn't get compiled into the assembly
      }

      // The following behaves as expected because the compiler knows
      // not to make any assumptions about the value of hubvar2, because
      // it was declared volatile
      hubvar2 = 0;
      if (!hubvar2) // compiler behaves as expected
      {
        ... // Code here gets compiled and executed
      }

Note: declaring `_COGMEM` variables `volatile` doesn't make sense
(except for the I/O registers such as INA) and will only introduce extra
assembler operations (copying data into pseudo-registers unnecessarily
etc.). Since cog memory can only be accessed by the cog where it's
stored, it can never change unexpectedly.

Automatic Data
--------------

For automatic data (i.e. local variables in functions) the compiler uses
general registers as much as possible. It will use the pseudo-stack in
the hub to save registers if necesary. In functions that are declared
`_NATIVE` or `_NAKED`, the compiler uses cog memory for automatic
variables instead of the stack.

How to Run Your Cog Module
==========================

Use the `cognew()` function declared in `propeller.h` to start a cog
with the code in your `.cogc` module. Somewhat unexpectedly perhaps,
what you pass to `cognew()` as first parameter is ***not*** the address
of your `main()` function (and it's impossible to get that address
anyway because each `.cogc` module has a different .text segment where
code is stored). The second parameter to `cognew()` is stored in the
`PAR` pseudo-register of the cog, and can also be used by your `main()`
function.

First Parameter to `cognew()`
-----------------------------

If you've programmed in PASM before, using the Spin tool, you may wonder
about whether your `main()` needs to be implemented at the top of your
`.cogc` file. After all, when you use `COGNEW` in Spin or in PASM, the
address you pass to it is the start of the PASM code in hub memory, and
that's where the new cog will start executing.

In C (or C++ or any other language besides PASM), the location of the
`main()` function is of no concern. The compiler and linker make sure
that the code from [crt0\_cog.s](PropGccInDepth#Startup_Code.md) is
stored at the top of cog memory so it gets executed first. The location
in memory of your `main()` function is irrelevant. So what parameter do
you need to pass to `cognew()` then?

> To start a `.cogc` module, the first parameter of `cognew( )` must be
> `_load_start_FILENAME_cog` where FILENAME is the name of your source
> file without the `.cogc` extension. For example, if your source file
> is called `my_awesome.cogc`, use `_load_start_my_awesome_cog`.

Note: even though the file name may be case insensitive to the operating
system that you use to develop with (particularly Windows), the case of
the `_load_start_FILENAME.cog` symbol has to match with the case of the
filename. In other words: if you would rename the file from
`my_awesome.cogc` to `My_Awesome.cogc`, you also have to change the code
so it uses symbol `_load_start_My_Awesome_cog`.

The compiler automatically takes care of generating the global symbol
`_load_start_FILENAME_cog` which represents the start of the hub memory
block where the code from your `.cogc` module is stored. There also is a
symbol for the end of the segment called `_load_stop_FILENAME_cog`.

Second Parameter to `cognew()`
------------------------------

The second parameter to `cognew()` is passed to the cog in the `PAR`
pseudo-register. Your `main()` function can use this parameter, but the
parameter is also used to initialize the `sp` stack pointer
pseudo-register.

That means the `mailbox` parameter to the `main()` function also needs
to be the end of the stack. Your code should look similar to this:

      #define STACK_SIZE ... // declare stack size

      static struct
      {
        unsigned stack[STACK_SIZE];
        struct mailbox_t mailbox;
      } cogdata;

      ...
      
      if (cognew(_load_start_my_awesome_cog, &cogdata.mailbox) >= 0)
      {
        // success...
      }

If you think the above looks kinda messy, or if you only want to pass a
single number instead of the address of a mailbox struct, you can also
do this:

      #define STACK_SIZE ... // declare stack size

      // Allocate an extra long in addition to the required stack size
      static unsigned stack[STACK_SIZE + 1];

      static struct mailbox_t mailbox;

      ...

      // Passing a mailbox pointer via an extra long just beyond the
      // end of the stack:

      stack[STACK_SIZE] = (unsigned)&mailbox;
      if (cognew(_load_start_my_awesome_cog, &stack[STACK_SIZE]) >= 0)
      {
        // success...
      }

      // In your .cogc module, declare your main() as follows:
      void main(struct mailbox_t **ppmailbox)
      {
        // ppmailbox is now a pointer to a pointer to the mailbox
        struct mailbox_t *mailbox = *ppmailbox;

        ...    
      }

      //----------------------

      // In the code above, if you only need to pass a single value
      // (e.g. an I/O pin number) instead of the address of a struct,
      // do this instead:
      stack[STACK_SIZE] = tv_pin;
      if (cognew(_load_start_my_awesome_cog, &stack[STACK_SIZE]) >= 0)
      {
        // success...
      }

      // In your .cogc module:
      void main(unsigned *pmypin)
      {
        unsigned mypin = *pmypin;

        ...
      }

If you want to run multiple cogs from the same `.cogc` module, you will
have to set up a separate stack for each cog. For example, you can
change to code as follows:

      #define STACK_SIZE ... // declare stack size

      static struct
      {
        unsigned stack[STACK_SIZE];
        struct mailbox_t mailbox;
      } cogdata[2];

      ...
      
      if ( (cognew(_load_start_my_awesome_cog, &cogdata[0].mailbox) >= 0)
        && (cognew(_load_start_my_awesome_cog, &cogdata[1].mailbox) >= 0))
      {
        // success...
      }

With the code shown above, each cog has its own mailbox. If you would
like to make all cogs use the same data in the hub, you can simply
declare the mailbox struct as a global variable and include the
declaration in the `.cogc` module. Example:

      #define STACK_SIZE ... // declare stack size

      // global data; you may want to put this in a .h file and #include it
      volatile struct mailbox_t
      {
        ... // add any number of fields
      } globals;
      
      static unsigned stack[STACK_SIZE];
      
      ...
      
      if (cognew(_load_start_my_awesome_cog, &stack[STACK_SIZE]) >= 0)
      {
        // success...
      }

In many cases, the mailbox is filled in before the `cognew()`, and then
used only by the cog that's being started. But in other cases, the cog
that gets started needs to report data back to the "calling" cog.

The Stack
=========

Arguably the most important problem of mixed-mode programming is: how
big does the stack need to be?

There is no easy answer to this question, but here are some hints: \* As
long as there are no recursive functions in your `.cogc` module, you can
count the number of occurrences of "`sub sp, #4`" in the generated
assembly, and use that count as the number of needed unsigned's in the
stack. \* You can reduce the use of the stack by using `_NATIVE` and
`_NAKED` in your `.cogc` module to minimize stack usage. *Don't make the
main() function in your `.cogc` module `_NATIVE`!* Making `main()`
`_NAKED` is okay. \* It's pretty easy to detect how many longs of stack
your program uses by initializing the stack array with known values that
are unlikely to occur on the stack, and later on checking how many stack
entries still have that value.

Even so, there may be factors that make it difficult to find out how big
the stack needs to be. For example, even if you put some detection code
in place, you will still have to make sure that your code execution
follows the "worst possible path" that generates the most possible stack
operations. If you use recursion you will also have to do some good
analysis of your code to determine how many recursions could happen in
the worst possible case.

The bottom line is: nothing is better to determine the required stack
size than a thorough analysis of the Assembly code that the compiler
generates. And the simpler your `.cogc` module is, the easier it is to
analyze it, and to make sure that stack overflows are not possible. With
a `_NAKED` `main()` function and all other functions `_NATIVE`, you
might not need a stack at all, but make sure you check the Assembly of
your code to check that the compiler agrees with you!
