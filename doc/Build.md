title: Building Propeller GCC
---

Today we can build everything on Linux, `*`Mac OSX, and Windows Cygwin
with the build procedure. Many of these instructions are derived from
the propgcc README.txt
http://code.google.com/p/propgcc/source/browse/README.txt

There are prerequisites for building Propeller GCC, you can find them
on the [prerequisites](PropGccBuildPreReq.md) page.

The [Openspin](https://github.com/reltham/OpenSpin) compiler created
by RoyEltham based on Chip's code now replaces BSTC. The Openspin
source is available on github: https://github.com/reltham/OpenSpin

Parallax and the Propeller-GCC team greatly appreciate the work done
by Brad Campbell on BSTC which can be used with Propeller-GCC. BSTC is
not necessary for compiling C programs with Propeller GCC, but may be
used in demos. For now BSTC is used for compiling items in the loader,
but the loader is not normally compiled by users. BSTC is distributed
with Propeller-GCC with written consent from Brad Campbell. BSTC and
friends are supported via the BST web site
http://www.fnarfbargle.com/bst.html

**Important**: If your build fails with something like:

    ../../../../propgcc/binutils/bfd/doc/bfd.texinfo:325: unknown command `colophon`
    ../../../../propgcc/binutils/bfd/doc/bfd.texinfo:336: unknown command `cygnus`

Then you need to downgrade texinfo. Currently, texinfo 5.0 and above is
not supported. Instructions for downgrading are
[here](http://forums.parallax.com/showthread.php/151005-PropGCC-build-fails-on-Ubuntu-13.10?p=1216485&viewfull=1#post1216485).

Build Propeller GCC on Linux or Cygwin
--------------------------------------

### Download the source

    1. Open a command window
    1. Create a folder for the project
    1. `cd` to your folder
    1. `$ cd "your folder"`
    1. `$ hg clone https://code.google.com/p/propgcc/ propgcc`
    1. `$ cd propgcc`

Please add /opt/parallax/bin to your path:

    $ PATH=${PATH}:/opt/parallax/bin

Alternatively, you can add it to your path by appending the following
line to your `~/.bashrc` file, and restarting your terminal:

    export PATH=/opt/parallax/bin:${PATH}

Please download and build
[OpenSpin](https://github.com/reltham/OpenSpin) and put it in your
PATH.

### Build PropellerGCC

Please run the following commands of from the root of your local copy
of the propgcc repository.

#### Linux/Mac

1. Set a GROUP variable.
1. `su root` (or use sudo for the following commands through "exit root")
1. `$ export GROUP="your group"`
1. `$ rm -rf /opt/parallax`
1. `$ mkdir /opt/parallax`
1. `$ chown ${USER}.${GROUP} /opt/parallax`
1. `$ chmod g+w /opt/parallax`
1. `exit root`

For release\_1\_0 branch 

1. `$ ./jbuild.sh 6 rm-all`
1. Go have a cup of coffee (build takes 15 minutes on I7 3.3MHz).

For default branch

1. \$ `make clean-all`
1. \$ `make`
1. Go eat lunch.

#### Windows Cross Compile

For default branch cross-compile to Windows

1. \$ `make clean-all`
1. \$ `make`
1. \$ `make CROSS=win32`
1. Go eat lunch.

#### RPi ARM Cross Compile

For default branch cross-compile to RPi

1. \$ `make clean-all`
1. \$ `make`
1. \$ `make CROSS=rpi`
1. Go eat lunch.

#### Ubuntu

1. `$ sudo rm -rf /opt/parallax`
1. `$ sudo mkdir /opt/parallax`
1. `$ sudo chown ${USER}.${USER} /opt/parallax`
1. `$ sudo chmod g+w /opt/parallax`

For release\_1\_0 branch

1. `$ ./jbuild.sh 6 rm-all`
1. Go have a cup of coffee (build takes 15 minutes on I7 3.3MHz).

For default branch

1. \$ `make clean-all`
1. \$ `make`
1. \$ Go eat lunch.

Note for Linux users: you may need to add your user to group `dialout`
to access the FTDI USB port:

    $ sudo adduser ${USER} dialout

#### Windows Cygwin

1. `$ ./rebuild.sh`
1. Take the day off.

#### Windows Msys/Mingw

For release\_1\_0 branch

1. `$ ./rebuild.sh`
1. Take the day off.

Mac OS X Build Procedure
------------------------

Visit the [Mac OS X page](PropGccBuildMacOSX.md) for more detailed
information. Note `*`Mac OSX users with Xcode version \< 4.2 must use
"native" GCC for builds instead of LLVM. Propeller GCC will not build
with LLVM on Xcode version 4.1. Xcode 4.2 users can build with either
GCC or LLVM.

MinGW Build Procedure
---------------------

Propeller-GCC uses MSYS and MinGW to build the tool-chain. MinGW is a
free Minimalist Windows interface for GNU based programs. Unmodified
MinGW binary tools and binary libraries can be used without any GNU
licensing restrictions whatsoever. MSYS is a minimalist operating
system environment for building programs like the Propeller-GCC
toolchain with MinGW. The MinGW build procedure requires that the
Windows user install MSYS and MinGW. Please install MSYS and MinGW as
top folders in your drive such as C:and C:using the latest installer
provided by at
http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/Installer/mingw-get-inst/
MSYS and MinGW must be in your %PATH% for the build to succeed.

MSYS IS NOT REQUIRED FOR BUILDING PROPELLER PROGRAMS. MinGW binaries
are distributed with Propeller-GCC according to terms described here:
http://www.mingw.org/license These terms are free in every sense of
the word with no strings attached for MinGW binaries.

#### Once you have MSYS and MinGW installed

Start a MinGW shell from the Start menu. Your shell prompt may look
different but we use \$ in the following to indicate the prompt;
don't type the \$ that's shown at the beginning of the commands.

Add a path to Mercurial, and /opt/parallax/bin:

    $ PATH="/opt/parallax/bin:/c/Program Files/TortoiseHg:$PATH"


Create a folder for your project with no spaces such as gccdev

    $ cd
    $ mkdir gccdev
    $ cd gccdev

Get the repository:

    $ hg clone https://code.google.com/p/propgcc/ propgcc

Getting the repository will take a long time. Sometime the clone will fail, and you will have to try again until it succeeds.

Once you have the repository:

    $ cd propgcc
    $ source fix-xcode-warnings.sh

Now start the release_1_0 branch build using the rebuild.sh script.

    $ ./rebuild.sh

Use make for default branch builds.

    $ make clean-all
    $ make

Rebuild from scratch takes about 40 minutes on a 3.3GHz CPU. A multiple job rebuild (jbuild.sh) may fail.
When rebuild completes without errors, you will find /opt/parallax fully populated.

#### Using Propeller-GCC after build

The MinGW build from the Windows command DOS window perspective will be in `C:\MSYS\local\propeller`.
You can copy this folder anywhere you want and use it to compile and load Propeller-GCC programs from 
the command window as long as your DOS %PATH% has your directory with bin in it.

For example:

1. Use Windows Explorer to copy the contents of `C:\MSYS\local\propeller` to `C:\propeller-gcc`.
1. `C:\>set PATH=C:\propeller-gcc\bin;%PATH%`
1. `C:\>cd gccdev\propgcc\demos`
1. `C:\gccdev\propgcc>make`

#### Creating a MinGW Propeller-GCC distribution

TBD

Build the .pdf Documentation
----------------------------

Once you have built Propeller GCC, you can generate .pdf documentation.
The TexLive or similar program will be needed for this.

    $ cd propgcc/../build/gcc
    $ make pdf
    $ make install-pdf

Documentation build is not part of the `propgcc/rebuild.sh` script mainly as
a convenience for developers. The .pdf documentation can be posted separately
for release. Files `/opt/parallax/share/doc/gcc/cpp.pdf` and 
`/opt/parallax/share/doc/gcc/gcc.pdf` are the compiler documents.

Build the Loader
----------------

Once you have installed Propeller GCC you should build and configure
the loader. 

* The loader lets you download applications.
* The loader is explained in [Propeller GCC Loader](PropGccLoader.md).
* There are some demonstration programs in [propgcc/demos](PropGccDemos.md).

Build Scripts
=============

Often changes are made that require removing the target build folder
and building from scratch. This happens less as time passes, but if
you see a build error that is not reported at the main page, it is
likely that you will need to rebuild everything.

The `jbuild.sh` and `rebuild.sh` script that comes with propgcc will build
everything from scratch. If you want to build without deleting
directories, just use `./jbuild.sh 6 rm-all` or `./rebuild.sh rm-all`

The `rebuild.sh` script calls `jbuild.sh 1`.
