title: External Memory
---

*NOTE: This is a work in progress.*

Propeller is a 32 bit microcontroller. It is designed specifically for
microcontroller applications where it shines.

Somewhere along the way as far back as 2006, people decided that having
external memory solutions for Propeller would allow even more
applications. One 2006 SRAM design is [described
here](http://forums.parallax.com/showthread.php?90158-Adding-more-RAM-to-the-Propellor&p=618599&viewfull=1#post618599)
but it uses almost all free Propeller pins. More recently, different SPI
devices have become common and with the advent of caching on Propeller
external memory designs have become much more useful.

Also in 2006 Bill Henning posted [his LMM
concept](http://forums.parallax.com/showthread.php?89640-ANNOUNCING-Large-memory-model-for-Propeller-assembly-language-programs!&p=615022&viewfull=1#post615022)
for allowing other languages to execute programs from HUB memory. Over
the years, this concept has been also used for executing programs from
external memory.

Propeller is a flexible and fun chip. We have all had fun stretching it
beyond it's intended design. Code executed from external memory
solutions will most likely never be as fast as code executed on chip -
so if you need that in-chip speed, an external memory solution will not
get it. If you need size and can sacrifice the speed of "business logic"
then this section will be interesting to you.

The current design philosophy for interfacing new hardware is described
here. A section that shows step by step integration instructions for new
designs is also provided.

External memory solutions available for use with Propeller GCC are
listed at the end with brief instructions on how to use them. It also
reserves space for designs that are not supported just yet.

Parallax has been patient with our desire and pursuit for external
memory solutions. In 2010, the C3 platform appeared in the Parallax
store, and today Propeller GCC supports the C3 in several different
memory models.

Volatile memory types SRAM, SDRAM, and SPI-RAM are supported only via
serial download now. An SD card based loader is in development.

External Memory Interface Design
================================

Today Propeller GCC uses a cache for encapsulating external memory
hardware. The cache is managed in part by the execution [COG](P8x32a.md)
and in part by a Cache COG. There is always a debate about what might be
better or worse. Propeller GCC uses a Cache COG today because the cache
design interface is easier and faster than the non-cached alternative.

The Propeller GCC Cache COG uses the following features which are
encapsulated in the cache\_interface.spin API: 1. Simple Cache access
API 1. Extra memory access API 1. Cache Line Pointer

The cache\_interface.spin API is written in the SPIN language mainly
because of legacy and small code size. The SPIN code can be found in the
propgcc tree at propgcc/loader/spin/cache\_interface.spin. The cache
interface is presented here in pseudo-code terms. The interface complies
with the so-called JCACHE interface designed by Steve Denson and David
Betz.

### Cache Interface API pseudo-code

This is a work in progress. The entire presentation idea may change from
pseudo-code to something else.

#### Conceptual Method Summary

    start(codePointer, mailboxPointer, cachePointer, config1, config2)
    readLong(address)
    writeLong(address, data)
    readWord(address)
    writeWord(address, data)
    readByte(address)
    writeByte(address, data)
    eraseFlashChip(address)
    eraseFlashBlock(address)
    writeFlash(address, buffer, count)
    sdCardInit()
    sdCardRead(address, buffer, count)
    sdCardWrite(address, buffer, count)

The way Propeller GCC reads or writes memory today is to fetch a cache
line pointer from the cache cog and use a `"`modulo index`"` for
getting the data. This reduces the cache code complexity in the COG,
but increases complexity some in the XMM VM kernel. The advantage in
having the XMM VM kernel do some work means that data within a certain
address range can be quickly retrieved without asking the Cache COG
for data again in many cases.

#### Conceptual Method Details

    start(codePointer, mailboxPointer, cachePointer, config1, config2)

The start method initializes the cache with pointers to the Propeller
ASM *codePointer* block, a *mailboxPointer*, and the *cachePointer*.
The *config1* and *config2* values can be passed to the cache
interface to define the number of cache lines in use and the expected
cache line length; the values are optional and if set to zero will be
ignored by the cache driver start up code. The start method returns
line mask so the XMM VM kernel "in-line detect" cache code will work.

    readLong(address)

This method will ask the cache to deliver a long from the physical
backstore *address*.

    writeLong(address, data)

This method will ask the cache to write a long *data* value to
physical the back-store *address*.

Propeller GCC writes to cache using the write-back method. The only
time a value actually gets written to the backstore is when a read is
requested on a cache line that has the dirty bit set.

    readWord(address)

This is the same as readLong except the data returned is word wide.

    writeWord(address, data)

This is the same as writeLong except the *data* is word wide.

    readByte(address)

This is the same as readLong except the data returned is byte wide.

    writeByte(address, data)

This is the same as writeLong except the *data* is byte wide.

    eraseFlashChip(address)

This method would be used to erase the entire flash chip at the
*address*.

    eraseFlashBlock(address)

This method would be used to erase a block at the *address*. The cache
driver is responsible for erasing the block(s) up to 4KB.

    writeFlash(address, buffer, count)

This method would be used to program a *buffer* block of *count* sized
data to the *address*.

    sdCardInit()

This method would be used for a board such as C3 where the SD Card
shares some chip select logic with other devices such as SPI Flash or
SPI SRAM. It initializes the SD card for use with read and write
methods.

    sdCardRead(address, buffer, count)

This method is available for same reasons as sdCardInit. This method
would be used to read data into a *buffer* block of *count* size from
the *address*.

    sdCardWrite(address, buffer, count)

This method is available for same reasons as sdCardInit. This method
would be used to write data from a *buffer* block of *count* size to
the *address*.

Propeller-GCC uses a mailbox for performing the access functions. The
following pseudo-code shows the mailbox commands for the methods
described above. The % sign indicates the numbers are a binary.

    // cache access commands
    WRITE_CMD             = %10
    READ_CMD              = %11
    
    // extended commands
    ERASE_CHIP_CMD        = %000_01  // only for flash
    ERASE_BLOCK_CMD       = %001_01  // only for flash
    WRITE_DATA_CMD        = %010_01  // only for flash
    SD_INIT_CMD           = %011_01  // only for C3 because of shared SPI pins
    SD_READ_CMD           = %100_01  // only for C3 because of shared SPI pins
    SD_WRITE_CMD          = %101_01  // only for C3 because of shared SPI pins
    
    CMD_MASK              = %11
    EXTEND_MASK           = %10      // used to detect an extended command

Integrating a new Design
========================

The GCC linker provides great flexibility in defining memory layouts.
A new hardware design may have different restrictions on external
memory. Generally in XMMC mode, only code will go into external memory
- you can define the size in a linker script that will generate an
error if that code size is exceeded. In XMM mode, you can specify code
and data in various sections defined by the linker. With the new
linker scripts it's easy to make a custom script for a board. As an
example, here is a C3 script used with XMM that defines the memory
model layout and sizes.

    MEMORY {
      hub     : ORIGIN = 0x00000000, LENGTH = 24K /* c3 cache driver uses upper 8K */
      ram     : ORIGIN = 0x20000000, LENGTH = 64K
      rom     : ORIGIN = 0x30000000, LENGTH = 1M
    }

    REGION_ALIAS("REGION_TEXT", rom);
    REGION_ALIAS("REGION_DATA", ram);

    INCLUDE propeller_xmm.ld
