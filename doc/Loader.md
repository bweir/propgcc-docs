title: Loader
---

The loader writes GCC programs to the Propeller via a serial port. The
loader and Propeller GCC can run on Linux, Mac OSX, or Windows.

This is a work in progress ....

Loader Features
---------------

-   Load GCC COG, LMM, XMM, and XMMC programs
-   Uses a config file for system properties
-   Parameters can overload/replace any config property
-   Loads specified XMM cache driver
-   Load SPIN .binary programs
-   Simple command interface
-   Built-in terminal for command line users
-   Make .pex files for executing from SD Card
-   Auto-identify serial ports

Installation
------------

The Propeller GCC distribution package will have the loader. In the
Linux package, it is placed in usr/local/propeller/bin (copied to
/opt/parallax/bin on install) and is accessible via the modified PATH
variable. Other installations will handle it differently.

Simple Usage
------------

Once a Propeller program is built with GCC, the propeller-load program
can send the code to the Propeller.

Below are a simple examples for command line users. The same type of
result can be had with and IDE like Eclipse, but it is work in progress.

For makefile users, some demo makefiles let you build and start
propeller-load with one command such as \$ make PORT=0 run

Loader Option Details
---------------------

The command line loader has a built-in syntax help that explains -r and
-t and the other parameters. Use propeller-load -h for help.

      Begin Example

    C:\>propeller-load -h
    usage: propeller-load
             [ -b <type> ]     select target board (default is 'default')
             [ -p <port> ]     serial port (default is to auto-detect the port)
             [ -I <path> ]     add a directory to the include path
             [ -D var=value ]  define a board configuration variable
             [ -e ]            write the program into EEPROM
             [ -r ]            run the program after loading
             [ -s ]            write a spin .binary file for use with the Propeller Tool
             [ -x ]            write a .pex binary file for use with the SD loader
             [ -l ]            load the sd loader into either hub memory or EEPROM
             [ -z ]            load the sd cache loader into either hub memory or EEPROM
             [ -t ]            enter terminal mode after running the program
             [ -t<baud> ]      enter terminal mode with a different baud rate
             [ -q ]            quit on the exit sequence (0xff, 0x00, status)
             <name>            elf or spin binary file to load

    Variables that can be set with -D are:
      clkfreq clkmode baudrate rxpin txpin tvpin cache-driver cache-size cache-param1 cache-param2
      sd-cache sdspi-do sdspi-clk sdspi-di sdspi-cs eeprom-first

    Value expressions for -D can include:
      rcfast rcslow xinput xtal1 xtal2 xtal3 pll1x pll2x pll4x pll8x pll16x k m mhz true false
      an integer or two operands with a binary operator + - * / % & | or unary + or -
      all operators have the same precedence

    The -b option defaults to the value of the environment variable PROPELLER_LOAD_BOARD.
    The -p option defaults to the value of the environment variable PROPELLER_LOAD_PORT
    if it is set. If not the port will be auto-detected.

    The "sd loader" loads AUTORUN.PEX from an SD card into external memory.
    It requires a board with either external RAM or ROM.

    The "sd cache loader" arranges to run AUTORUN.PEX directly from the SD card.
    It can be used on any board with an SD card slot.

      End Example

> All propeller-load options are optional except for `<`name`>`.

-   -b `<`type`>` select target board (default is default) \> This
    option allows users to select a board type from the
    propeller-load.cfg configuration file. The configuration file
    contains several board types and variables for each type. The
    configuration file variables are described further down in the page.

> The target board type "default" which is used if -b is not specified
> will use an 80MHz XTAL1+PLL16x clock unless overridden byte a -D
> variable.

> The board type is not needed for LMM and COG only programs which match
> the default board type. A board type can be defined in the
> propeller-load.cfg file that will match properties of boards that do
> not use defaults.

> XMM and XMMC programs always require specific hardware, and the -b
> option allows the user to select the board type from the configuration
> file for those modes.

> It is useful to note that the build MODEL (LMM, XMM, XMMC) determines
> how the code is executed rather than the board type. Even if you
> specify -b eeprom with a program compiled for LMM mode, the program
> will execute from HUB memory rather than from eeprom.

> It is also useful to note that if you build an XMM or XMMC model
> program and the loader board type is not specified, you will end up
> with an error because the loader doesn't know how to load the program.

-   -p `<`port`>` serial port (default is /dev/ttyUSB0) \> Normally -p
    sets the port. If -p is not specified the port will be /dev/ttyUSB0
    for Linux, COM1 for Windows, or the value of environment variable
    PROPELLER\_LOAD\_PORT if set. MAC OSX users must specify the serial
    port name used by propeller-load either on the command line or in
    PROPELLER\_LOAD\_PORT.

> If -p 1 is set for propeller-load on the linux command line,
> /dev/ttyUSB1 will be used. If you are not using USB, you should
> specify the -p; I.E. -p /dev/ttyS0

-   -I `<`path`>` add a directory to the include path \> The loader can
    use a specific path to search for an alternative propeller-load.cfg
    config file and external memory cache driver.dat files. Cache driver
    .dat files are output of compiled PASM, GAS, or possibly COG C files
    designed to inter-operate with the XMM VM kernel code to give it
    access to external memory. This parameter allows you to specify the
    path for the alternative files.

-   -D var`=`value define a board configuration variable \> The loader
    reads -D to change values programmed on the Propeller. Normally the
    values will be specified by board type on the propeller-load.cfg
    file, but there are situations where this is less desirable.
    1.  For example, the default board type used when -b is not
        specified uses 80MHz clock frequency and XTAL1+PLL16x clock
        mode; this is not appropriate for all boards. Some boards such
        as the Parallax SpinStamp need clock mode XTAL1+PLL8x, so using
        -Dclkmode=XTAL1+PLL8x will allow running a program on the
        SpinStamp (these values can also be set by the compiled
        program).
    2.  For another example, during Engineering Environmental Corner
        testing one of the variables used is clock rate. The -D option
        will allow the user to specify the clock rate without needing to
        change a file. This type of feature also allows the user to have
        an interactive record for data collection.

> The -D variables are listed in the help output. Below is the same list
> with some explanation and valid usage examples. 1. clkfreq : An
> integer number such as 80000000, 96000000 1. clkmode : XTAL1+PLL16x,
> RCFAST, or other`*` 1. baudrate : 115200, 57600, 38400, 19200, 9600 1.
> rxpin : An integer from 0 to 31 inclusive - typically 31 1. txpin : An
> integer from 0 to 31 inclusive - typically 30 1. tvpin : Only used for
> loader debug if enabled in code 1. cache-driver : `<`filename`>`.dat
> 1. cache-size : depends on cache-driver 1K, 2K, 4K, 8K (some power of
> 2). 1. cache-param1 : depends on cache-driver 1. cache-param2 :
> depends on cache-driver \> Note`*` clkmode can be RCSLOW, RCFAST,
> XINPUT or a combination of these symbols as xtal+pll: XTAL1, XTAL2,
> XTAL3, PLL1X, PLL2X, PLL4X, PLL8X, PLL16X.

-   -e write the program into EEPROM

> This option is used to save the Propeller GCC boot-up program into
> EEPROM. The boot-up program will be different for COG, LMM, and
> XMM/XMMC programs. COG and LMM programs will be saved into EEPROM as
> Propeller bootable .binary image. If the external memory code (.text)
> storage is flash, the XMM/XMMC program will be saved and the flash
> boot-up program will be saved in EEPROM. If the code storage is SRAM,

-   -r run the program after loading \> This option is used to save
    Propeller GCC boot-up code in HUB memory and cause execution to
    start without resetting the Propeller. It will also save any
    XMM/XMMC code into the hardware external memory device specified by
    the board in the propeller-load.cfg file. This mode can be used for
    testing XMM/XMMC programs loaded into external SRAM, SDRAM, or other
    non-volatile memory.

-   -s write a spin binary file for use with the Propeller Tool \> This
    option allows the user to convert a COG or LMM GCC elf program into
    a binary that can boot on any Propeller having the correct clock
    configuration.

-   -x write a .pex binary file for use with the SD loader \> This
    option is used to convert a linked Propeller GCC program to an image
    that can be booted on Propeller from an SD card. An image file to
    boot on the Propeller from SD card should be named AUTORUN.PEX (yes,
    all upper case. It may work if saved as lower case. Your mileage may
    vary).

-   -l load the sd loader into either hub memory or EEPROM \> This
    option must be used with the -r or -e option. The SD card loader may
    live in HUB or EEPROM. The purpose of the SD card loader is to copy
    the image from the SD card file AUTORUN.PEX to external memory and
    start the program. To put the loader into EEPROM, one must also
    specify -e on the command line. This will allow you to boot the SD
    card program without being connected to the PC. To put the loader
    into HUB ram, one must use -r.

> An AUTORUN.PEX file intended to run in SRAM or other non-volatile
> memory type must be compiled/linked using an appropriate linker
> script. For example, to run the fibo program as an XMMC program, it
> must be generated with something like this:

     $ propeller-elf-gcc -Os -mxmmc -Txmmc_ram.ld -o fibo.elf fibo.c

> More details on default scripts for linking different XMM programs can
> be found in the [Propeller-GCC linker scripts](LinkerScripts.md) page.

-   -t enter terminal mode after running the program \> This option will
    start a 115200 serial terminal immediately after loading. To exit
    the terminal today, press ESC. This escape mode may not be suitable
    for programs that use arrows or other extended keyboard command
    sequences.

-   -t`<`baud`>` enter terminal mode with a different baud rate \> This
    option is the same as -t except it lets the user specify the
    baud-rate for communications.

-   -q quit on the exit sequence (0xff, 0x00, status) \> This option is
    used to make propeller-load exit when a program finishes by sending
    the 0xff, 0x00, status sequence. It is used primarily in the GCC
    test suite.

-   `<`name`>` GCC elf or SPIN binary file to load \> This required
    parameter is the input program for the loader to use. In the case of
    the -s option, it is the program to convert to a SPIN binary.

Loader Configuration File
-------------------------

The Propeller GCC loader uses a [configuration
file](PropGccLoaderConfig.md) for specifying board information used to
boot an image. The configuration file is not a run-time parameter file
for devices, that information is defined by the user program.

The [propeller-load.cfg](PropGccLoaderConfig.md) file contains
properties for board types such as hub, ssf, dracblade, sdram, and
eeprom. Each board type contains a set of properties that are used by
the loader for boot up.

> ### COG or LMM Board Type
>
> Here is a simple LMM example:

    Begin Example

    [hub]
        clkfreq: 80000000
        clkmode: XTAL1+PLL16X
        baudrate: 115200
        rxpin: 31
        txpin: 30
        tvpin: 12   # only used if TV_DEBUG is defined

    End Example

> Each of these fields are the same as the -D variable names mentioned
> above. As mentioned, these values can be overloaded by the -D flag if
> necessary. To use the HUB board type run as: \$ propeller-load -r -t
> fft\_bench.elf -b hub

> To modify the HUB board type to use 96MHz, the loader can be run as:
> \$ propeller-load -r -t fft\_bench.elf -b hub -Dclkfreq=96000000

XMM/XMMC programs require a suitable board type to define loading the
cache driver.

> ### XMMC Board Type
>
> An XMM program will typically keep code and global data in external
> memory. The C3 board type will run an XMM program from Flash and have
> data in the SRAM. The C3 configuration properties look like this:

    Begin Example

    [c3]
        clkfreq: 80000000
        clkmode: XTAL1+PLL16X
        baudrate: 115200
        rxpin: 31
        txpin: 30
        tvpin: 12   # only used if TV_DEBUG is defined
        cache-driver: c3_cache.dat
        cache-size: 8K
        cache-param1: 0
        cache-param2: 0

    End Example

> In this example you will notice that c3\_cache.dat is defined as the
> cache driver.

> ### XMMC Board Type
>
> An XMMC program will typically keep only code external memory. The
> EEPROM board type will run an XMMC program from Flash and have data
> and stack in the Propeller HUB memory. The EEPROM configuration
> properties look like this:

    Begin Example

    [eeprom]
        clkfreq: 80000000
        clkmode: XTAL1+PLL16X
        baudrate: 115200
        rxpin: 31
        txpin: 30
        tvpin: 20   # only used if TV_DEBUG is defined
        cache-driver: eeprom_cache.dat
        cache-size: 8K
        cache-param1: 0
        cache-param2: 0
        eeprom-first: TRUE

    End Example

> In this particular example you will notice that eeprom\_cache.dat is
> defined as the cache driver. The cache size and the two cache
> parameters are also defined. Normally cache-param1 and cache-param2
> are 0 to signal using the default values in the cache driver. The
> eeprom driver can use different values, but it's best to leave them as
> they are.

> The Propeller program can literally be stored in the EEPROM upper
> address space and be executed by fetching instructions from the EEPROM
> via the cache. Some may scoff at this option as being too slow, but it
> is the minimalist hardware configuration for XMMC programs and it
> performs reasonably well considering the EEPROM access speed. Programs
> using this cache model can be up to 96KB for an AT24C1024B 128KB
> EEPROM.

> The eeprom-first parameter tells the loader to program the EEPROM boot
> image before programming the Propeller-GCC program. This allows a
> single programming step with propeller-load. If the EEPROM was not
> programmed first, part of your program would be wiped clean by the
> Propeller ROM, and would fail to boot. The EEPROM XMMC board type is
> the only one where this is a concern now.

> propeller-load.cfg
> ------------------
>
> The [propeller-load.cfg](PropGccLoaderConfig.md) file usually found in
> /opt/parallax/propeller-load contains basic board type descriptions.
> The file does not specify user device information.
