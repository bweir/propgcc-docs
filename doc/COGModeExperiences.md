title: COG Mode Experiences
---

I wanted to write a device driver in C so I tried using PropGCC COG
mode. This is a mode that generates code that runs entirely in a COG.
While the COG is limited to only 496 longs of instructions and data,
code in COG mode can run faster than LMM, XMM, or XMMC modes.

Details
=======

Some things to remember:

Declare the main function with `_NAKED`:

For example:

    _NAKED int main(void)
    {
        ...
    }

Declare other functions with `_NATIVE`. These functions should not be
recursive and you can probably only get away with a single level of
function calls. In other words, the main() function can call other
functions but those functions can not call a third level of functions.
This will likely generate references to a hub memory stack.

For example:

    static _NATIVE void do_something(void)
    {
        ...
    }

Declare variables with `_COGMEM`.

For example:

    static _COGMEM int mask;

Beyond these suggestions, I've found it necessary to continually
disassemble the generated code to find out whether stack instructions
were generated. This can be done with the following command:

    propeller-elf-objdump -d my_program.elf

This will produce a disassembly of your program which you can examine to
find references to `sp`. If you find any, you'll have to rearrange the
code to eliminate them. Often, the cause of these references to `sp`
will be failing to follow one of the preceeding suggestions. Other times
the cause may be more subtle.
